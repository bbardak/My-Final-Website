      <p class="text-center small">One of my greatest achievements has happened during a 6-week business development and social entrepreneurship scheme I took part-in, in Kenya. I worked with a team of consultants, alongside Kenyan entrepreneurs, to scale existing businesses and implement start-up ideas focusing on sustainability. As part of my role, I delivered classes to improve the entrepreneursâ€™ knowledge of basic business skills such as cash flow, and gross profit margin calculations. I also prepared reports and detailed financial statements for the entrepreneurs who pitched for an interest-free loan. Subsequently, 100% of my entrepreneurs obtained funding which they could then use to buy new stock and equipment for their businesses.  I believe this to be my greatest achievement because I added value and helped to improve the lives of the entrepreneurs, not just by helping them to receive funding, but also by providing them with the tools and business acumen to scale their businesses on their own.</p>
